Division of workload:

Zack:

Create min and max temp files using the datafilter.sh, use csvreader.cpp file to obtain useful data for plot, and plot data using hist1.cpp, using correct flags for compiling.
This should give you a histogram for the hottest and coldest days of each year, for the given dataset.

Jesper:
Create "tempOnDay.C" that takes month and day as argument and return a histogram containing the temperatures of that day throughout the years.
Create "comp.C" that compares the temperature of a given month between two datasets.
Bash script "data_cleaner.sh" which cleans data so its easier to read for "tempOnDay.C" and "comp.C"

Ashar:
Declare/initialize constructor which in "tempTrender.h/tempTrender.cpp" which intitializes an array (as a member variable) containing average daily temperature over some period of years. Construct a member function in the class, it should plot the histogram with error bars. The class is called in project.cpp. Above mentioned filtering done in bash script "data_cleaner2.sh". Worked as release manager.
